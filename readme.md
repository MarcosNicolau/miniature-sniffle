## An awesome collection

This repo is a collection of all the assignments, mock tests and exercises I've done through the paradigmas de programaci√≥n class at UTN FRBA.

During the year we see the following paradigms

-   Functional: haskell
-   Logic: prolog
-   OOP(Object Oriented Programming): wollok
